\chapter[Available energy of trapped electrons]{Available energy of trapped electrons}
\label{chap: AE-TE}
With our understanding of the bounce-averaged drift cemented, we now focus shift our focus to the \AE{} of trapped electrons. Let us note that this publication has been published in two parts. Firstly, a highly condensed version of the presented results was published as a Letter for a general physics audience \cite{mackenbach2022available}. In a later publication, we have included additional findings into the research, and have given more details of the derivation, and it is this publication which we include in the thesis. \par 
The publication focuses on the \AE{} of trapped electrons, as eluded to before, where the result of \cite{helander2020available} will be generalized to account for non-omnigenous effects. The most important part of the investigation, though, is its comparison against nonlinear gyrokinetics. Prior to the research, it was unknown if the \AE{} of trapped electrons holds merit as a measure for turbulence, and with the proceeding publication we connect it to some aspects of this turbulence. \vfill \newpage
